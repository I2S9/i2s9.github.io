### 1. Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Accounting for 25% of all cancer cases and affected 2.1 million people in 2015. Early diagnosis significantly increases the chances of survival. A key challenge of cancer detection is how to classify tumors into malignant or benign.

ML (Machine Learning) techniques can dramatically improve the accuracy of diagnosis. 91% correct diagnosis is achieved using machine learning techniques

Objective of this project : classify tumors into malignant or benign tumors using features obtained from several cell images

### 2. Cancer diagnosis procedure

* FNA process which consist of extracting some of the cells out of the tumor, at this stage we don't know if that tumor is malignant ou benign

* The malignant (= cancerous, we need to intervene) tumor it matches the image at the top and the benign ( = tumor is kind of not spreading accross the body, the patient is safe somehow) tumor, at the image below

* As we extracted all the images and we wanted to specify if that cancer out of these images is malignant or benign

* Features means some of the characteristics of the image such as radius, for example of the cells, texture, perimeter area, smoothness and so one and then we feat all of the features for our machine learning model
