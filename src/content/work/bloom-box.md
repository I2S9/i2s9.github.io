 The fashion industry is undergoing a dramatic transformation by adopting new computer vision and ML and deep learning techniques. We're going to use the Fashion MNIST data that contains images like dress, bags and shoes We want to build a model (based on deep learning & machine learning model) that look at an image and tell us what type of clothes. We can do target marketing to specific customer
